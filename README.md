_Be seen. Be heard. Be experienced._

LOUDVERSE is a 2-sided marketplace for funding hard-to-quantify public goods like music, poetry, and theater.

### [Watch the demo video](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cizir6uy73hzof5/AADIp7qNw-t7ywOOeZ3W6Pyma?dl=0)

## Some behind-the-scenes
✍️ _**Crowd-Commissions**_ are ERC1155 non-transferrable tokens representing "proof of patronage”

🧾 _**Double Constrained Quadratic Funding**_ calculates matching funds with both a fixed subsidy pool and minimum viable funding goals. 

🎨 _**Smart-Art**_ is an ERC721 NFT that shares financial upside with collaborators and contributors using a royalty allocation table

# LOUDVΞRSΞ
_Be seen. Be heard. Be experienced._

## Project Overview
LOUDVΞRSΞ is a 2-sided marketplace to help creators sustainably ship creative work.

On one side is Creators and their Collaborators, on the other side is Fans, Funders, and Commissioners ——

## Problem Statement
Web3 offers creators many opportunities to fund and monetize their work. But there is still an open design space for funding hard-to-quantify public goods like music, poetry, and theater at scale.

## Solution Approach
We propose a new web3 primitive — the _**crowd-commission**_.

Crowd-commissions blur lines between creator/fan, analog/digital, empowering artists in ways never before possible. In support are two additional innovations — _**double constrained quadratic funding**_ and _**smart-art**_.

Let's jump in to see our dapp in action then show some behind-the-scenes and technologies used.

### How does it work?

#### 1) Creators open calls for funds

#### 2) Fans/funders can review creators' past work and contribute to interesting calls 

#### 3) Contributions are matched from a subsidy pool each round using double constrained quadratic funding

#### 4) Funds are streamed to creators during the creation process

#### 5) Creators build their on-chain reputation and deepen their connection with fans/funders as they ship creative work

## Some behind-the-scenes
✍️ _**Crowd-Commissions**_ are ERC1155 non-transferrable tokens representing "proof of patronage”

🧾 _**Double Constrained Quadratic Funding**_ calculates matching funds with both a fixed subsidy pool and minimum funding goals

🎨 _**Smart-Art**_ is an ERC721 NFT that shares financial upside with collaborators and contributors using a royalty allocation table
